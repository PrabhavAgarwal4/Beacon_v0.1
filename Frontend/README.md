# Beacon Frontend

A modern, responsive recruitment management interface built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite**. This application provides a seamless experience for students, recruiters, and administrators to manage the end-to-end placement cycle.

## Overview

Beacon Frontend is a role-based single-page application (SPA) that interfaces with the Beacon Backend API. It features distinct dashboards tailored to three primary user types:

* **Students**: Discover opportunities, manage professional profiles, and track application progress.
* **Recruiters**: Post job openings, manage candidate pipelines, and review student credentials.
* **Admins**: Oversee platform integrity by moderating job posts and verifying user identities.

The UI is designed for high performance, featuring optimistic state updates and a clean, data-driven aesthetic.

## Tech Stack

* **React.js (Vite)**: Core framework for UI components.
* **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for consistent, professional design.
* **React Router DOM**: Declarative routing and role-based access control.
* **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for API communication.
* **Lucide React**: Iconography for dashboard navigation.
* **React Context API**: Global state management for authentication and user sessions.
* **Framer Motion**: Smooth transitions and component animations.
